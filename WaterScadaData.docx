Water SCADA analysis
Data at hand:
ESLR ID
Date
Time
Water Level
Flow data
ESLR capacity

Some assumptions about data:
The has no major trends as the values lie between [0, max_capacity].
The data has a seasonality on daily basis with a significant amount of noise/anomalies.

To do:
Detect anomalies in the data.
Report filling and distribution times on a daily basis depending upon the available data.
Some strategies:
Transform the unevenly-spaced data into evenly-spaced data.
Apply exponential smoothing on the data to smooth out the noise.
Since the data has no label, we can apply some unsupervised techniques(K-means clustering) to get some insights about the data.
Apply anomaly detection algorithms and algorithms to understand the seasonality and trends in the data.
